//this code doesn't do anything  right now
//the plan is to use this script to transfer data between the form and calendar
//but idk how to do that yet, still researching lol

//let month;
let day;
//let date;

function getDate(inputDay){
    const day = inputDay;
    return day;

}

//document.getElementById('results').append();
